# N-Queens & Rooks

Everyone knows this classic problem set, so a friend & I attacked it. We actually ended up more focused on the mathematical sets and deriving solution counts or working solutions than working on coding the problem; and when we coded it tended to be finding novel ways to write the logic. Probably not a great idea to use this as a model for efficient n-queens solvers.

The backbone-based board visualizer is kinda fun, though. May update with a proper efficient solver in the future.
